# Portfolio template for ENGL2730
## What you're looking at here
A "github repository" is essentially a folder of files, hosted on a web server, that can be collaboratively edited. You're going to have your own version of this repository, which is where you will build your portfolio website throughout this class.

## What you need to do to get your own site started

1. Sign up for your own github account
2. Make a public repository named [yourusernme].github.io
3. Put two files from this repository into your own repository: 2730-portfolio.html and styles.css

You'll know it's working because if you go to https://[yourusernme].github.io/2730-portfolio.html you will see a website!
